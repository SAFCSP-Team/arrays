# Arrays
### Objective
The project's main focus is understanding arrays, declaring them, accessing their elements using indexes, and performing operations on them in c++.

### Problem
Create an array of integers `nums`, print it, update an element, and print it again.

### Implementation
- Create an array `nums` with 10 elements.
- Initialize the array with default values from 1 to 10.
- Print the array.
- Update the value of the second element to 20.
- Print the array after updating it.
- Print the length of the array.
- Print the last element in the array using the index.
  
``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /*Add your code here*/
    return 0;
}
```
